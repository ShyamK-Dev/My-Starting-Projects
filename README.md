# My-Starting-Projects
I built my first 10 projects using HTML and CSS, gaining hands-on experience in web development. These projects allowed me to master the fundamentals of structure, layout, and design, while enhancing my understanding of web standards. Each project strengthened my skills and helped me grow as a developer.
